# Hinode - A clean documentation and blog theme

Hinode is a clean documentation and blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), an open-source static site generator. Based on the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) framework, the rendered site is fast, secure, and responsive. Hinode uses [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) to enable full text search across your site. Finally, the theme supports [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com) (npm) to automate the build process and to keep track of dependencies.

Detailed information about Hinode is available on the [official website](https://gethinode.com).
