## Setup

> **Note**: you need to have the Hugo extended version installed in order to use this theme. This theme uses SCSS for styling. With Hugo extended version, SCSS can be compiled to CSS.

To create a new Hugo site with this theme, run the following command:

    hugo new site myblog

Then, clone this repository into the `themes` directory of your new site:

    cd myblog
    git clone https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome.git themes/hugo-blog-awesome

To preview the thmeme with example content, run the following command from the `exampleSite` directory:

    hugo server --themesDir ../..

## Usage

To use this theme, set the `theme` variable in your site's `config.toml` to `hugo-blog-awesome`:

    theme = "hugo-blog-awesome"

## Configuration

You can have a look at the `config.toml` file in the `exampleSite` directory for an example configuration.
I recommend you to copy the `config.toml` file from the `exampleSite` directory to the root directory of your Hugo site. Then, you can edit the `config.toml` file to suit your needs.

## Content

### Posts

To create a new post, run the following command:

    hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

Then, edit the `my-first-post.md` file to suit your needs.
